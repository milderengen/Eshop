# Eshop
So basically, my first big project with tons of php code, SALE code is JAREX10, i am currently still working on this site so act accordingly.
(i am adding this README something like half a year after working on this last time, so maybe some things won't work on online version.)
http://milderengentestsite.fun/ link to site itself

Functionality:
- Ability to shop clothes from site
- Sale codes
- registration and log-in system(you are not able to shop without it).
- Email after finishing your order(Is not working after google changing it's politics about third parties in private emails)
- Working shopping cart
- Every product has own page
- Size selection
- Categories
- Admin GUI to delete or add goods from/on page (credintials obviously not here as it connects to my main database)
- Defense against sql injections and some basic defense against being able to reach sites that you are not supposed to reach normally.

To do:
- Frontend part of project sucks hard, design is fine and dandy but Liquidity and responsivness of site is not dealt with at all.
- Repair mail system to use something more stable, improving e-mails content as well.
- Add other functionalities to Admin interface, managing users etc. Also, it is just html code so add styling.
- Finish advanced categories function, being able to select for example Blue+Helly Hansen+Jackets option.
- Re-do Base categories code, it can be done with pretty simple function, but at the time big complications occured so in heat of the moment, i just hard coded things.
- Theoretically add at least some kind of fake "pay-gate" so it feels like real shop.
- Adding option to buy more pieces of one thing.
- Solving http error codes pages, 404 etc.
- Adjust error messages so People don't just see everything as it gets blown out on site.
